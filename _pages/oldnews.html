                            <p>Mason Competitive Cyber had their first meeting of the semester Wednesday, September 6th, in JC Room D (basic track) and SUB1 3B (advanced track) with a great deal of success. Both rooms experienced higher visitor counts than expected. Both meeting slidedecks and an advanced session recording are available to members per request. The next meeting will be September 13th, though the room remains slightly uncertain.

                            <p>Mason CC sent a team to Annapolis for "Crack the Shell", a CTF competition. This was a CTF run on August 12th in the Oâ€™Callaghan Annapolis Hotel, with $1000 being the grand prize. Unfortunately we didn't win so we don't have an exact placement but we believe they landed around eighth. Food and drink was provided.
