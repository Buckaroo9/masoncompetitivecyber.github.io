    <h2>Harasssment Policy</h2>
    <br />
    Mason CC is dedicated to providing a safe and comfortable atmosphere for persons of protected classes, whether that's sexual orientation, gender, sex, ethnicity, disability or anything else traditionally protected. We echo this <a href="https://getconnected.gmu.edu/organization/masoncc/documents/view/549321">in our constitution</a>.

    <h3>Reporting</h3>
    <br /><br />
    While we firmly believe complaints that are not anonymized are easier to handle, (as we can communicate with the accuser on what we believe is an appropriate remediation, any details that may further validate the accusation, etc) we understand some may not be comfortable with coming forward on an anonymous basis.<br /><br />
    We provide an at least pseudo-anonymous reporting method at the bottom of this page, with an elaboration as to how you can further protect your identiy. It's specifically bound to the account for Michael Bailey, the president. <b>The President and Co-President/Vice President are looped in by default.</b> If you feel this is not sufficient, or it involves the president or co-president, we'd refer you to the GMU Office of Student Involvement. Our email addresses are mbaile18@gmu.edu (Michael Bailey, acting president) and pbenoit@gmu.edu (acting co-president) and will stay with us until we request it not.

    <h3>Remediation</h3>
    <br />
    Mason CC's President and Co-President (or, in cases in which this is no longer a position, vice president) will determine the appropriate remediation strategy, whether that's a discussion to be had (more likely in situations where there is discomfort rather than outright abuse, stalking or other forms of harassment), suspension from any of our platforms or our community, expulsion from the organization, expulsion from Slack, competitions, meetings, or anything else.
    <br /><br />In the event a disagreement is made, George Mason entities will be looped in, such as the Office of Student Involvement. The benefit of the doubt will be given to the accuser.
    <br /><br />
    <b>Nothing actionable will take place until the accuser is satisfied. Accusers will be asked before anyone is looped in,. If the accuser is anonymous nobody will be looped in beyond the President and Co-President (or VP).</b>
