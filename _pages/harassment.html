    <h2>Harasssment Policy</h2>
    <br />
    Mason CC is dedicated to providing a safe and comfortable atmosphere for persons of protected classes, whether that's sexual orientation, gender, sex, ethnicity, disability or anything else traditionally protected. We echo this <a href="https://getconnected.gmu.edu/organization/masoncc/documents/view/549321">in our constitution</a>. We encourage those affected by harassment, especially due to their class, or those who hear about or are otherwise witness to harassment to come forward so higher level CC administration can remediate it to ensure it doesn't happen again. For the purposes of the document, victims and those who bring forward harassment stories secondhand are further referred to as "accusers", but we understand they are victims of something that often goes unreported and has plagued our industry, and as such we understand they are more than just "accusers" in the scope of things.

    <h3>Reporting</h3>
    <br />
    While we firmly believe complaints that are not anonymized are easier to handle, (as we can communicate with the accuser on what we believe is an appropriate remediation, any details that may further validate the accusation, etc) we understand some may not be comfortable with coming forward on an anonymous basis.<br /><br />
    We provide an at least pseudo-anonymous reporting method at the bottom of this page, with an elaboration as to how you can further protect your identity. It's specifically bound to the account for Michael Bailey, the president. We also have a mailbox at the GMU Office of Student Involvement but may not check it as regularly as we check electronic communication.<br/>
    <br /><b>The President and Co-President/Vice President are looped into the situation by default.</b> If you feel this is not sufficient, or it involves the president or co-president, we'd refer you to the GMU Office of Student Involvement. Our email addresses are mbaile18@gmu.edu (Michael Bailey, acting president) and pbenoit@gmu.edu (acting co-president) and will stay with us until we request it not.

    <h3>Remediation</h3>
    <br />
    Mason CC's President and Co-President (or, in cases in which this is no longer a position, vice president) will determine the appropriate remediation strategy, whether that's a discussion to be had (more likely in situations where there is discomfort rather than outright abuse, stalking or other forms of harassment), suspension from any of our platforms or our community, expulsion from the organization, expulsion from Slack, competitions, meetings, or anything else we feel is appropriate and have permission over.
    <br /><br />In the event a disagreement is made, George Mason entities will be looped in, such as the Office of Student Involvement. CC certainly feels the benefit of the doubt should be given to the accuser and we will not try to "hide" anything from higher level authorities. We will not go out of our way to tell anyone we weren't explicitly given permission to, but we also encourage those to loop in anyone else they feel relevant such as GMU offices or, should it turn criminal, law enforcement.
    <br /><br />
    <b>Nothing actionable will take place on the administration's behalf until the accuser approves of the actions. Accusers will be asked before anyone is looped in, as well as asked before any remediation or punishment is rolled out. If the accuser is anonymous nobody will be looped in beyond the President and Co-President (or VP), as well as the accusee should a remediation come in the form of punishment.</b>

    <h3>Third Parties (Non-CC Harassment)</h3>
    <br/>
    Should another organization member (such as a CTFer from another school or a hackathon attendee at a hackathon we went to as a function) harass a CC member or otherwise make them uncomfortable, we would still prefer to be notified. We have trusted contacts in the industry (executive members at other CTF clubs, hackathon organizers, etc) so we may be able to provide assistance (still maintaining the above bolded discretion) and would like to modify our (i.e. if it took place at a certain event we may want to reconsider that event) itinerary in the future as approriate. However, we understand for many the fewer who know the better, and we respect that as well as long as they're receving the response from the other organization they desire.
