<h2>Meeting</h2>

<p>Meetings are generally held on Wednesday from about 5-6pm. Make sure to join our Slack at masoncc.slack.com to get the latest notes on it in the event of changes. Meeting attendance is <b>NOT</b> mandatory. We try our hardest to record meeting information such as slides and actual talks, so contact us in Slack if you want to catch up at all. Most topics, however, are independent of one another</p>

<h2>Training</h2>

<p>Most of training takes place at meetings. If you missed out on anything meetings-wise, consult the "What'd you Miss" Excel sheet in our internal Google Drive (let us know for link access) or just the training folder in general, which includes everything covered in meetings, resource pages, and more. A great deal of this website is based off of what was in the GDrive.</p>

<h2>Competing</h2>

<p>Competitions are incredibly informal in organizing most often, but planning teams generally take place in the #ctf-watch and #general channels in Slack. Limited attendance competitions in which we were invited will be handled by the executive officers, but advanced members will more than likely take favoritism to ensure George Mason maintains a good reputation in cybersecurity. Watch Slack closely for this.</p>
