<h2>Mason CC VM Instructions page</h2>

Below are instructions as to how to use our Virtual Machine. It's worth noting instructions may vary.

<h3>Step 0: Ensure you have enough space</h3>

To check your disk space on Windows, check out My Computer and under C:\ (or whatever your primary partition is, if you don't know what it is it's C:\). You should see verbage similar to that of "x free of y" where x is your free space. You need as much as 20GB for this process to take place comfortably.

In most Linux OSes you can run <code>df -h</code> to verify your primary partition has adequate space.

<h3>Download the virtual machine.</h3>

</p>
<h3>Download and set up VMware Workstation Player</h3>
Player can be downloaded <a href="https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/free#desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_workstation_player/14_0">Here (v14)</a>
</p>
<h3>Slack Invite System</h3>
<p>One of our better more prominent features is that we use a Lambda function, <a href="https://gist.github.com/mike-bailey/52fcfb42ba0087755118bfb07676e21c">available here</a>, that automatically invites people to . We use AWS API Gateway to route requests to the function with the standard Lambda integration. This kind of setup is commonly referred to as "serverless" infrastructure because you only pay for runtime, not for actual rented server time. It's about $3.50 for a million requests last I checked, so divide that by about 100 thousand, throw in logging in CloudWatch and other bells and whistles, and that's what we get.
</p>
<h3>CiCi Bot</h3>
<p>Our bot runs on <a href="https://labs.vse.gmu.edu/index.php/Systems/Zeus">Zeus</a>, a GMU cluster available basically to engineering students. It supports a variety of modules and while I'm (Michael Bailey) more familiar with Ruby slackbots as that's my work, it supports really old Ruby and recent Python. After hardening my account to prevent token leakage, we run our bot by SSH'ing in and invoking `nohup` to keep it live. Zeus only cleans orphaned processes, which it does not qualify as. The code is available at <a href="https://git.gmu.edu">GMU's Git server run by SRCT</a>, of which Michael Bailey is the System Administrator, so he has root on it.</p>

<ul>
<li>What if I have a different form of Linux?</li>
If you have a reasonable form of Linux such as Ubuntu as Fedora, or a more custom type like Gentoo or Arch but you know how to use it, you'll be fine.

<li>Can't I just do this at a meeting?</li>
<b>No.</b> People show up and try to do this and the download takes quite a while. You'll probably have a diminished experience at the meeting as a result.
