<h3>CyberFusion</h3>
<p>CyberFusion, while what everyone has used to refer to the competition, was a larger conference that surrounded the <b>Cyber Cup</b>. The conference consisted of a multiple-hour job fair with popular recruiters such as AWS Security and Raytheon. After GMU got 5th last year, students were given more authority in how to design the team. Ultimately, the competing team ended up being all CC members. They were coached by <b>Dr. Jim Jones</b> and <b>Dr. Peggy Brouse</b>. The competing team was:
<ul>
  <li>Ammar Al-Kahfah</li>
  <li>Michael Bailey</li>
  <li>Paul Benoit</li>
  <li>Chuck Tran</li>
  <li>Chris Issing</li>
  <li>Chris Roberts</li>
</ul>
<br />
There was also an observing team consisting of:
<ul>
  <li>Doreen Joseph</li>
  <li>Natalie Parke</li>
  <li>Kang Xu</li>
  <li>Steve Zamory</li>
</ul>
It consisted of a variety of challenges, including web, crypto, reverse engineering, and even IoT. <b>Mason CC had a final score of 1780 and ultimately won the event.</b> Multiple challenges CC solved such as Hidden, but a popular point of content was the IoT challenge, one where there was a discrepancy in whether or not removing the SD card from a Raspberry Pi is considered a <i>hardware mod</i>. Our decision was ultimately ruled as legal, but the action itself was retroactively banned. CC also made great connections, strengthening our relationship with a few colleges, including VT (2nd) and Radford (3rd).<b>Christopher Roberts</b> had an exceptionally good performance, getting just about all of the reverse engineering problems (split across two categories, Bond and Reverse Engineering) with <b>Chuck Tran</b>'s advice.

<h3>BSidesNOVA</h3>
<p>BSidesNOVA's Team CTF was an event taking place on the second day of <a href="bsidesnova.org">the larger conference</a>. They competed for $1,000 cash. They didn't win, but at a professional conference that can happen, especially with an incomplete roster. It was an attack/defend competition essentially that was incompatible with the experience with the team (it would've been a different story if it was Jeopardy). It did, however, motivate multiple attendees to further pursue training and the organization.
<ul>
  <li>Taylor Cacciotti</li>
  <li>Tyler Lambert</li>
  <li>Brandon Wong</li>
  <li>Naveed Yahya-Zadeh</li>
  <li>Duc Tri Nguyen a.k.a <i>cothan</i></li>
  <li>Hung Mao Chen a.k.a <i>1pwnch</i></li>
  <li>(Absent) Stephen Pirkey</li>
  <li>(Absent) Connor Reguero</li>
</ul>

From that team, the debrief essentially revealed (rewritten quote):
<br /><br />
They experienced minor technical difficulties. It was heavily involving throwing metasploit and other kali tools at open ports but it wasn't quite as trivial as that. There was an interesting scoring system that incorporated money and number of flags captured. When you captured a flag, you would get money and your total number of flags capped would increment. the other half of the challenge was running a "botnet" script on compromised machines. The longer you ran it the more money you would accumulate. Money could be spent on hints. They all had fun a learned a bit about metasploit so no one regrets going and we all had a good time.
