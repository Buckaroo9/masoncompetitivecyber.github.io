<h3>Panda... Panda... Panda...</h3>

<p>
  Mason CC will be at Panda Express on August 31st. We'll be fundraising for our organization pretty much all day, with 20% of orders <b>when they're given the below flyer</b> will be directly added to our student org account. Again, to be clear: When shown the below flyer, a portion of your order's cost will be given to the club. Please click it to launch it in a new window.

  Examples of things we've spent money on in the past include... 
  <ul>
    <li>Competition Fees (e.x. National Cyber League, CCDC)</li>
    <li>T-Shirts</li>
    <li>Events</li>
  </ul>
  and things we could theoretically spend on in the future include... 
  <ul>
    <li>Travel Stipends for in-person event drivers (currently volunteers)</li>
    <li>Hardware (likely only Panda funds would work here)</li>
    <li>Meeting hands-on materials</li>
  </ul>
