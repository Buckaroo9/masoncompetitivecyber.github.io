<h3>Addressing Anonymous Feedback Given to Exec</h3>

<p>
  Recently, Mason CC put out a end of year survey and got a lot of good feedback. 
  We're going to track our responses here as we get responses. Actionable items are in red.

  the one thing that really bothered me this semester was when there would be a guest speaker, and people that come late just stand at front door and are peeking in for a few minutes before coming in. It was really distracting (for me at least) and i think a notice should to be put on the door or somewhere to let them know to come in the back door.

<p class="answer">
  This is getting fixed. We expect to do exactly what was suggested here. If possible we can also lock the front door.

    This sounds like a cool club that id LOVE to participate in but i dont know where or when things are. Slack isnâ€™t functional for me
</p>
<p class="solution">
  Meeting topics are posted to this website and 90% of the time Twitter as well. The Slack announcements are just autogenerated from the website. The only other option suggested to us was Discord but other than channel history Discord isn't the same and in my (Michael Bailey) opinion it's less usable.

    Please centralize a place for go.gmu.edu hyperlinks - its hard to remember all of them, perhaps putting links of front page through resources instead of digging through gdrive will help.
</p>
<p class="solution">
  We had a bot that did this but it killed over. As a result of this we've edited our site with a <b>Key Links</b> button at the <a href="/meeting/">Meetings</a> page.
