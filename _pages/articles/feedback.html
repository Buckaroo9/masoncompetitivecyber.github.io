<h3>Chris Roberts (caffix) of Battelle to Present on Binary Exploitation</h3>
<p>Wondering how hackers take vulnerabilities in something like C code at a low level and make them exploits? Christopher Roberts of Battelle will be speaking to the organization on multiple key elements of binary exploitation. This will include live examples/demonstrations, as we frequently have at Mason CC. Thanks Chris! We will also have beginner meetings and other advanced meetings before/after it, so feel free to check the meeting tab. They will take place at the usual Wednesday 5-6pm meeting time. As a reminder, Mason CC covers topics largely related to competition in a competition context, but there will be real world applications to the things we cover.
