<h3>Addressing Anonymous Feedback Given to Exec</h3>

<p>
  Recently, Mason CC put out a end of year survey and got a lot of good feedback. <br />
  We're going to track our responses here as we get responses. Actionable items are in red.<br />
  Of note, the votes for: <i>How did you think we did running the club this year?</i> are 3 3's, 1 4 and 4 5's. <i>Do you prefer this years or next year's meeting time?</i> is split 50/50 even. <i>How comfortable did you feel signing up for competition?</i> is split the same way as the running question. <i>Did you participate in the GRIMM Challenge?</i> is 75% No's. <i>More or less guest speakers at meetings?</i> is 37.5% "I didn't attend", 37.5% "more", 12.5% "the same" and 12.5% "less."

    Posting the talks online is super helpful for people who can’t make it to meeting so keep it up. Kick the schools admins/reps out of our slack channel
</p>
<p class="answer">
    We're sitting on one talk so I posted that now (AV Evasion), so thanks for the reminder. With regard to admins/reps, we've agreed if they're lurking at least we're deactivating them, which we know there's two professors and both were inactive so we've sent them a notification of change of policy and deactivated their accounts.

Why does nobody ever eat the food?
</p>
<p class="solution">
  Funny enough that's actually actionable. We're moving some of our budget requests to Paisano's and Einstein's rather than Sodexo.

    Perhaps email lists will work better on announcing events and stuff, something weekly can help with publicity.

    As we gain more leverage, probably use it - we can look at what other popular student orgs are doing and copy them.
</p>
<p class="answer">
  This is actually how we built a lot of our org. We copied SRCT. SRCT does website + slack, which is what we do presently. We had an email list and nobody joined it. We don't want to have to control more mediums than we already do (Slack, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and Website) so we're trying to avoid branching out to Email and Discord, which is also commonly asked about. However, we do make regular appearances on VSE's mailing list.

  the one thing that really bothered me this semester was when there would be a guest speaker, and people that come late just stand at front door and are peeking in for a few minutes before coming in. It was really distracting (for me at least) and i think a notice should to be put on the door or somewhere to let them know to come in the back door.
</p>
<p class="answer">
  This is getting fixed. We expect to do exactly what was suggested here. If possible we can also lock the front door.

This sounds like a cool club that id LOVE to participate in but i dont know where or when things are. Slack isn’t functional for me
</p>
<p class="answer">
We have weekly meetings and events posted on the site. That said, I'd wonder why Slack isn't functional. Usually it's because people use the web app or something without realizing there's a mobile app or something.

    use a mic when giving presentations. the meeting videos on youtube have poor audio quality to the point where you miss things being said. planning for ctfs (transportation, dinner, etc) could be better. carpoolers should try and carpool with their teams so they aren't arriving at different times, messing up seating arrangements, signing up their team when someone already did, etc. videos for beginners trying their first ctf. videos showing more experience competitors solving ctf problems while commentating their thought process and using a few acronyms as possible. as a beginner seeing someones thought process and methodology is more important than knowing what tools they use.
</p>
<p class="answer">
  As a non-profit, someone would have to pay for the mic out of pocket unless we somehow finessed it from GMU. Planning is going to be improved, mostly via an itinerary. It's important to note some carpoolers leave at different times due to personal reasons, whether that's sleep schedules, classes or other obligations. We are however going to introduce hard deadlines in an itinerary format. For instance "If you aren't at the hotel by 6:00 we're eating without you" and related things for competition and arrival. This was decided after VT Summit where dinner the first night was kind of a shitshow.

<p class="solution">
  Meeting topics are posted to this website and 90% of the time Twitter as well. The Slack announcements are just autogenerated from the website. The only other option suggested to us was Discord but other than channel history Discord isn't the same and in my (Michael Bailey) opinion it's less usable.

    Please centralize a place for go.gmu.edu hyperlinks - its hard to remember all of them, perhaps putting links of front page through resources instead of digging through gdrive will help.
</p>
<p class="solution">
  We had a bot that did this but it killed over. As a result of this we've edited our site with a <b>Key Links</b> button at the <a href="/meeting/">Meetings</a> page.

  (Re: Budget) I would love to get more insigt into what Mason CC CTF is
</p>
<p class="solution">
  Right now, it's just a line item in our budget. However, multiple groups including our own membership body, our sponsors and GMU have expressed major interest in us hosting a full-on CTF at GMU. This is the line item for that event. It's looking very likely right now and it's also looking likely Battelle supports it.
</p>

<p class="question">
    (Re: Budget) Super excited for the Mason CC CTF. Just cover driving, meals, and housing at CTFs (if possible)
</p>
<p class="solution">
  Meals are easy and are already dictated in a budget subsheet. Drives are possible only if you're a GMU student unless an outside sponsor decides to, and covering a GMU student's drive time to a GMU event is kind of backwards. Housing is insanely hard, especially given it's our first CTF.

<p class="question">
    I didn't join the the very end of this semester as I had no idea this club even existed. It might be worth while to put out some sort of promotional marital at the start of the next semester such as a poster or something around campus. 
</p>
<p class="solution">
  We get this a lot and while we're going to be more aggressive next year (at least about visiting class sections), we do this a lot. We've been to RSO fairs, the Engineering Week in the atrium, have put TV ads out, have put flyers up for both events and the org itself, and we're on the mailing list regularly.

    Email listing and email announcements can work.<br />
    There needs to be more marketing. Drop in CYSE 101 classes or talk to jones- he can probably set something up like CS 110. same thing with CS112/entry level programming courses. Look athe way other student orgs market themselves and copy them.
</p>
<p class="solution">
  As stated previously we've dropped in on CYSE101 before but not this semester. It's a matter of manpower in that it's easier said than done. We did drop in on a gen-ed Engineering class this year. I also went to CS112 at one point. Re: <i>look [at the] way other student orgs market themselves and copy them</i>, we steal from SRCT's book pretty aggressively. Hopefully a more active and distributed exec board will fix this though.

    I would personally like more beginner friendly events/workshops that way we can meet and work with people around our skill level.
</p>
<p class="solution">
  While we underadvertised this, our first attempt at this was LinuxFest which was a Saturday meeting that was intended to get people going on Linux. Zero people attended. We'll work on this however, and will likely have more beginner meetings.

    Use Discord, maybe have some other things like how some clubs have “Fun Friday” or something.
</p>
<p class="solution">
  Slack vs Discord is a massive debate and presently the vote tends to land like 10% Discord 90% Slack, especially given other orgs use Slack. We don't want to maintain two separate channels. However the more fun events thing is also gonna be a thing.

    casual get togethers...maybe a board/video game
</p>
<p class="solution">
  We'll definitely be doing more of this if I (Michael Bailey) can get help on it in exec.
