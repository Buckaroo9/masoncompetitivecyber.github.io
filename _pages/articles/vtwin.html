<b>MasonCC2 finished in first place with a score of 1730 and MasonCC finished in second with a score of 1115</b>, and the remainder of teams finishing sub-1000 (exact scores are unavailable). Winning members were presented with Yubikeys and all members debriefed with VT CSEC members afterwards. Attendance was approximated to be around or above 100 competitors with students from a number of schools including GWU, Tennessee Tech, ODU, UT Knoxville, VMI, VCU, VT, and others.

<br /><br />Members were provided hotel accomodations and food and refreshments by VT CSEC.

Certain problems may have their solutions disclosed at a later time by the authors at VT, but challenges varied from traditional reverse engineering and forensics, to playing physical puzzles, to finding a flag in a USB’s unallocated space. Thank you to the organizers and everyone else involved in putting on an amazing event.<br/><br/>

This marks the third consecutive time CC has placed, with CC having placed 3rd at UMBC's CyberDawg CTF a few days ago and 1st at VMI’s Cyber Fusion Cyber Cup a few weeks ago.
