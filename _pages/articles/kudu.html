<h3>Mason CC to host Sam Williams (murmus) giving a talk</h3>
<p>
Mason Competitive Cyber will host Sam Williams of Kudu Dynamics in our advanced track, which will take place in JC Room G (what was previously the basic room), for our next meeting on September 27th from 5-6pm. All are welcome, and note some of this content may be advanced, covering CSAW CTF in general, and a dive into their recent gopher challenge. We're more than happy to answer any questions on our Slack. We're very happy to have him. Please visit our main page if you're looking for an invite to our Slack, where you can get any of your questions regarding the talk or our meetings answered.
