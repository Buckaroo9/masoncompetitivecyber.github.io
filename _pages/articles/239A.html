<p>239A is a bit harder to find. If you're coming up from the middle staircase and are facing the library, you'd take a right towards the star lab. You should be passing a small hallway with an elevator and be dumped into a small room with tables. Go right when you pass the elevator and it should be on your left. If you passed a staircase and bathrooms, you did it right.</p>
