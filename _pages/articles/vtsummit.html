<p><i>
VT Summit is a (somewhat) annual competition provided by Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, VA. This year it's on March 17, 2018. Last year we were provided a hotel room and sent a team of about 8.<br /><br />

We got 2nd place last time we went, losing only to VCU over a problem they physically took the answer from, which was ultimately ruled social engineering.
This was when our club was significantly less developed, so we're optimistic about next year.
