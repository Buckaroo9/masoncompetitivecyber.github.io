<h3>LinuxFest Special Meeting</h3>

<p>Mason CC will be meeting from 3-6pm on October 22 (this Sunday) in Johnson Center Room A. This will hopefully provide a way for people in other organizations that use Linux to learn Linux while allowing people who don't generally make meetings to be able to make it out to meetings. <b>PLEASE BRING A LAPTOP, ESPECIALLY AS WE ARE GOING AS PAPERLESS AS POSSIBLE. Also please try to log into vcl.gmu.edu ahead of time to verify you can. We expect to use VMware Workstation.</b></p>

<p>The LinuxFest meeting will comprise of three tentative workshops:
<ul>
<li>Getting Running on Linux (similar to that of our Basic Linux meeting)</li>
<li>Using Linux as a Server (WordPress/LAMP install on CentOS 7)</li>
<li>Customizing and Scripting Linux</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
Some level of technical ability is preferred as we will be covering a variety of material in a relatively brief period. People are welcome to come late but please note they may build.<br>
Materials will be made available after the meeting.
</p>
