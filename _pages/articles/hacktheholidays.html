  <p>Hack The Holidays hosted by HackEducate was an event we sent a small team to held on 613 Global Way, Linthicum Heights, MD. CC did relatively okay, placing 5th out of 8 in a competiton that involved larger company teams. We did enjoy the problems, especially when infrastructure becomes a PART of the problem, rather than the orgaizers just uploading files. <b>They also did an exceptional job getting a venue together, food, etc.</b> Below we are going to break down a few of the problems we liked, but it's important to note a few problems relied on tools like DirBuster, which utilize brute forcing. Especially when networking is problematic (which it was), CC does not brute force in any fashion because it's against rules in a variety of competitions, so we didn't last long in 1st place. Please note some of this is off of memory.</p>

    <p>CC scored a total of approximately 875. Problems ranged from 50-500 points, with them mostly coming in two stages: One problem to get read access on a box, one to get root on that box. The total was as such:
      <ul>
        <li>Subdomain Hijack - Value: 500 (only one team was allowed to solve this)</li>
        <li>Web User - Value: 100</li>
        <li>Web Admin - Value: 150</li>
        <li>Git User 2 - Approximate Value: ?150?</li>
      </ul>
      Problems we did <b>not</b> get included:
      <ul>
        <li>Freebie User - Value: 50</li>
        <li>Freebie Admin - Value: 50</li>
        <li>Encryptor Admin - Value: 100</li>
        <li>Git User - Value: 125</li>
        <li>Storage User - Value: 150</li>
        <li>Storage Admin - Value: 150</li>
        <li>Sarah User - Value: 200</li>
        <li>Sarah Admin - Value: 200</li>
        <li>Git Admin - Value: 250</li>

    <b>Subdomain Takeover</b><br />
    Without further ado, let's get into our nest egg problem, the "Sudomain Hijack" problem. You had to take over test.hackedctf.com, which is exhibited by hosting content at that domain. It was a relatively simple one, largely predicated on knowledge of AWS S3, a storage service run by Amazon Web Services. It's largely known as a storage service, but it also works as a static website hosting service. As a result of this, you can point your domain to it and ccreate a bucket (effectively a top level folder, if you aren't familiar with AWS) by the name of that domain in AWS, hosting your content there.
    <br /><br />
    Figure 1 displays approximately what you'd expect to see when you visited test.hackedctf.com in your browser. This made it easy. Creating a bucket by the name of test.hackedctf.com showed approximately what you see in Figure 2. Once you upload a file, in our case "tips.html", set it to the homepage, set the bucket to be a public static web hosting bucket, and the file (in AWS referred to as an <i>object</i>), you have enough to prove control.

    <b>Web User</b>
    <br />
    <p>Web User involved an outdated version of WebCalendar. The version is clearly displayed in various parts of the site, and it is thoroughly out of date. It's exploitable to get a simple shell via msfconsole, with the output below.</p>

      Ultimately, you'd find yourself with a standard shell.

    <b>Web Admin</b>
    <br />
    <p>Web Admin was compounded on the prior problem involving the shell we got in Web User. It involved a misuse of the system() call. In /home/leo/ on the system, the only user with a home directory, you found a <b>run</b> binary with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setuid">setuid</a> set and root ownership. When it executes, it executes as root. Any static analysis at all, which we did by base64'ing the file a la <i>base64 /home/leo/run</i>, copying the base64 of the file, then decoding it back into the file and throwing it in our team's comms channel, reveals it simply ran <i>system("cat /etc/passwd")</i> in C. <a href="https://www.go4expert.com/articles/exploit-c-t24920/">This is not a new vulnerability,</a> and I've seen it in a CTF when they made Twitch collectively exploit a binary in a "Twitch plays" fashion (the chat votes on the keystrokes), but the idea rests on the fact that "cat"'s location is decided by the PATH variable, which is under the user's control. Running <i>export PATH=/tmp:$PATH</i> means if you put a valid executable named /tmp/cat (must chmod +x to make it executable). I made /tmp/cat a one line shell script, first running ls /root to reveal a flag.txt file, then doing cat /root/flag.txt. The issue here is that you just broke cat to fix this. I caused an infinite loop on multiple occasions and kept having to kill my session and re-exploit. Ultimately, creating a one line shell script in /tmp/cat and invoking /home/leo/run results in the execution of /tmp/cat and as such, reading the flag.txt to the shell.</p>

  <div class="span6">
    <b>Git User 2</b>
    <br />
    <p>Git User 2 was interesting, because it was both a Gitlist server at port 80 and a Jenkins server at port 8080. I should disclose we used our (only) hint on this challenge. Gitlist was running a vulnerable version (0.4) and was succeptable to a no-auth RCE. The exploit code is available at the bottom of the blog (safe to click) <a href="http://hatriot.github.io/blog/2014/06/29/gitlist-rce/">here</a>. The biggest pain is you have to consider the system, and how the exploit makes assumptions on infrastructure. It assumes you're attaching /var/www/gitlist, but we're attacking /var/www/html. Setting the cache to /var/www/html gives us a simple PHP shell, and if we change our base64 payload to a more complex PHP shell, which we spent too much time on, we're granted that. We then used that shell to find the flag and read it.</p>
