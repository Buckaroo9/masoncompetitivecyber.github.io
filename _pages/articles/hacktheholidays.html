<p>Hack The Holidays was an event held on 613 Global Way, Linthicum Heights, MD we competed in. CC did relatively okay, placing 5th out of 8 in a competiton that involved larger company teams. Below we are going to break down a few of the problems we liked, but it's important to note a few problems relied on tools like DirBuster, which brute force. When networking is a concern, CC does not brute force in any fashion, so we didn't last long in 1st place. Please note some of this is off of memory.</p>
