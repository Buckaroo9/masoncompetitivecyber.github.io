<h3>Mason CC to host Robert Shein of PwC on Car Hacking</h3>
<p>
Robert Shein of PricewaterhouseCoopers will be covering car hacking at our October 11th meeting in JC Room <b>C</b>, not to be confused with JC Room G. This topic will both educate our organization on car hacking and on his involvement at PwC. No major prior experience in car hacking is to be expected of attendees.
