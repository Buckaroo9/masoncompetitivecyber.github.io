<br>
<p>RIT RC3's 2017 CTF, an online event that hosted up to 300 teams, ended Sunday, Nov 19 after running since Friday at 12:30 to see Mason CC's first team, MasonCC0, win second place overall. <i>"Contagion"</i>, a RIT team, won first place. This is the second place a team running under Mason CC has placed second, the other being <a href="http://vtcsec.org/summit.html">VT CSEC's Summit</a>, a significantly smaller in person event.

<br /><br />
As MasonCC0 rotates quite a bit we want to personally recognize the members of this team:
<ul>
  <li>Stephen Pirkey</li>
  <li>Chris Roberts</li>
  <li>Jake Robie</li>
  <li>Connor Reguero</li>
  <li>Ameer Takieddin</li>
</ul>

Chris Roberts is a previous club speaker and a few of them are long time members.

<h3>Congratulations to MasonCC0 and Contagion</h3>
