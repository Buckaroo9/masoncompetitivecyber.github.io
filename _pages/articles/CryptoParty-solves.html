<h2>CryptoParty 2018 Writeups</h2>
<b>By Michael Bailey</b>

<h3>GPGee Whiz</h3>
<p class="solution">
0x8CF2369BC83FD660 is "my" key on pgp.mit.edu. Note you
<br /><br />
It shows an email at root@bombdiggity.competitivecyber.club
<br /><br />
dig -t txt bombdiggity.competitivecyber.club
<br />
results in a TXT record

<br /><br />
It follows the character set +,=,and a-zA-Z so we should consider base64. We base64 decode it and base64 doesn't break, but it looks compressed.
<br />
Try to gunzip it:
<br />
<code>
echo H4sIAMG+l1oAA0ssMq40KE0xTE83zEs3DOECAO1kxYUQAAAA|base64 --decode|gunzip
<br /><br />

<h3>GPS Coordinates</h3>
<p class="solution">
You're provided with tupac.jpg.
<br /><br />
Tupac is alive. I know it. Can you help me find out which city he's in?
<br />
Try to run exiftool. This was in the hint. Note the GPS Coordinates.
<br />
<code>
GPS Position                    : 20 deg 1' 30.06" N, 75 deg 49' 4.26" W
<br /><br />
Flag: Santiago de Cuba
</code>

<h3>Git Good</h3>
<p class="solution">

Because Michael (Mason CC's president) is an idiot, his Github got hacked. Can you find out who hacked it and maybe get in touch with them?
<br />
After scrolling you find https://github.com/mike-bailey/mean-evil-haxxor. In a legendary stupid move, I trusted a key I shouldn't have. However, if you note the commit.
<br />
In addition to doing it through the github interface
<code>
â‡’  git log --show-signature
gpg: Signature made Thu Mar  1 04:55:10 2018 EST
gpg:                using RSA key A8BE47B0A92177004AF9CE3462B06F2335F6D858
gpg: [Something like "no public key"]
39ca1e0 - (HEAD -> master, origin/master, origin/HEAD) haha hacked. you'll never find me now. (8 weeks ago) <Michael Bailey>

Search for it in <a href="http://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?search=0x62B06F2335F6D858&op=index">pgp.mit.edu</a>.
</code>
<br /><br />
You get something when you email them in response!
<code>
  Drat! You've found my secret address! Well, I guess you can have my flag: gPg33_wh1z_s1gn3d_comm1tz

<h3>HAXOR</h3>
<p class="solution">
Okay, I'll just have one bi(y)te...<br />
<br />
7f56545c17565b5b17435f5217435f5e595044
<br /><br />
This is a simple XOR Cipher
<br /><br />
Consider the following script:
<br />
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mike-bailey/6b75b1fbb9c81c8100b646c157b0291f.js"></script>
<br />
On execution, displayed flag: Hack all the things

These are unsalted MD5 hashes. Personally, I can't say if it'd work, but <i>hash_identifier</i> in Kali would probably tell you MD5 is at least a candidate. In addition, they're only one character hashed.
<br /><br />
Consider the following MD5 cracker that assumes an ordinal range of 127 or below, but cracks instantly:
<br />
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mike-bailey/26695b1cf95dda5bbd14baed96b18da0.js"></script>
