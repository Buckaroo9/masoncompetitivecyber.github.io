<h3>GPGee Whiz</h3>
<p class="solution">
0x8CF2369BC83FD660 is "my" key on pgp.mit.edu. Note you
<br /><br />
It shows an email at root@bombdiggity.competitivecyber.club
<br /><br />
dig -t txt bombdiggity.competitivecyber.club
<br />
results in a TXT record

<br /><br />
It follows the character set +,=,and a-zA-Z so we should consider base64. We base64 decode it and base64 doesn't break, but it looks compressed.
<br />
Try to gunzip it:
<br />
<code>
echo H4sIAMG+l1oAA0ssMq40KE0xTE83zEs3DOECAO1kxYUQAAAA|base64 --decode|gunzip
<br /><br />

<h3>GPS Coordinates</h3>
<p class="solution">
You're provided with tupac.jpg.
<br /><br />
Tupac is alive. I know it. Can you help me find out which city he's in?
<br />
Try to run exiftool. This was in the hint. Note the GPS Coordinates.
<br />
<code>
GPS Position                    : 20 deg 1' 30.06" N, 75 deg 49' 4.26" W
<br /><br />
Flag: Santiago de Cuba
</code>
</p>

<h3>Git Good</h3>
<p class="solution">

Because Michael (Mason CC's president) is an idiot, his Github got hacked. Can you find out who hacked it and maybe get in touch with them?
<br />
After scrolling you find https://github.com/mike-bailey/mean-evil-haxxor. In a legendary stupid move, I trusted a key I shouldn't have. However, if you note the commit.
<br />
In addition to doing it through the github interface
<code>
â‡’  git log --show-signature<br />
gpg: Signature made Thu Mar  1 04:55:10 2018 EST<br />
gpg:                using RSA key A8BE47B0A92177004AF9CE3462B06F2335F6D858<br />
gpg: [Something like "no public key"]<br />
39ca1e0 - (HEAD -> master, origin/master, origin/HEAD) haha hacked. you'll never find me now. (8 weeks ago) <Michael Bailey><br />

Search for it in <a href="http://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?search=0x62B06F2335F6D858&op=index">pgp.mit.edu</a>.
</code>
<br /><br />
You get something when you email them in response!
<code>
  Drat! You've found my secret address! Well, I guess you can have my flag: gPg33_wh1z_s1gn3d_comm1tz

<h3>HAXOR</h3>
<p class="solution">
Okay, I'll just have one bi(y)te...<br />
<br />

This is a simple XOR Cipher

<script src="https://gist.github.com/mike-bailey/6b75b1fbb9c81c8100b646c157b0291f.js"></script>

These are unsalted MD5 hashes. Personally, I can't say if it'd work, but <i>hash_identifier</i> in Kali would probably tell you MD5 is at least a candidate. In addition, they're only one character hashed.
<br /><br />
Consider the following MD5 cracker that assumes an ordinal range of 127 or below, but cracks instantly:
<br />

After running ls and seeing a ._certainly_notaFlag.txt file, this is for cat'ing the flag:

<h3>ScrapeScoop</h3>
<p class="solution">
<br /><br />
Password is three terms and/or words concatenated. It's important to note people like building wordlists around people's known info. Maybe our website, perhaps?
<br /><br />
Key bits here:

<ul>"Our": Mason CC's</ul>
<ul>I believe we also hinted again at it being CC's site</ul>
<br />
I wrote a Ruby script to identify any words and try to unzip. If it detected a fail, try again. If it succeeded, halt execution and wave.

Upon unzipping the file, you get flag.txt and it's: .

<h3>Trivia 1</h3>
<p class="solution">
<br /><br />
Which cipher did Jefferson use to communicate with Livingston about the Louisiana Purchase?
______'s _____

Hint cost 5
<br /><br />
Apologies for the confusion but ____ was meant to offer the format, not exact character length. Hint was "Who's Cipher?"
<br />
Flag: Patterson's Cipher
</p>


<h3>Trivia 2</h3>
<p class="solution">
<br /><br />
Real Life Enigma
<br /><br />
This was a point of contention. It WAS the Crypto Museum in MD, then someone disproved it and it was the Spy Museum, then it was the Pentagon. Paul did it. It's Paul's fault.
<br />
Flag: Pentagon
</code>
</p>

<h3>M. Night Shyamalan</h3>
<p class="solution">
<br />
Are you picking up my signs?
<br /><br />
Hint cost 3
<br />I dropped a hint in announcements saying people need to take it literally, and we also provided <a href="https://twitter.com/masoncompcyber/status/990621732892561408">a Tweet of us walking in</a>.
<br /><br />
Ultimately, there was a QR code on the back of the sign as you walk in.<br />

Scanning it results in masoncc{w0w_s0_cre4tive}

<h3>(Not Really) Actually Using Enigma</h3>
<p class="solution">
<br />Full Challenge text is a bit long:
<code>
As the best allied cryptanalyst in WWII, you are our last hope for decrypting these two secret messages from the Germans:
1)
MJHGBRSNUNFASVFZQMMHFXWZLI
2)
XOMJQJZQSNTNKCEOSXARATABVJSHUWKAAMFSPDAHF
Luckily, the Germans lost all of their enigma machines and have resorted to using a python enigma emulator. We know three things already
The first message is HEYHITLERWANTSANEWNICKNAME
The Germans are using I II III as the rotors
The plugboard is 'AV BS CG DL FU HZ IN KM OW RX'

Can you tell us what they need to start calling Hitler? (all uppercase no spaces)

Hint Value 5
</code>
<br />
This was called "Not Really" because you probably should've used a python library of some sort to solve. Just about everything was provided but ring settings. Brute forcing it would be relatively trivial, and below is an example if you knew ring settings.

<h3>Gotta Golang Fast!</h3>
<p class="solution">
<br /><br />
Google shills must've made this problem!<br />
<br />
(note you may need to guess a character of the flag)<br />
<br /><br />
Hint value 5
<br /><br />
This one was a bit of a red herring. People who actually do reversing probably loaded this into IDA Pro or radare2 or something. While possible, it's a really painful way to do this due to the standard libraries golang has and how noisy they are from a function perspective. It only expects a password file matching a certain hash. That hash is of <a href="https://shattered.io/static/shattered-2.pdf">Google's second SHAttered PDF</a>, which would come up with a quick search. If you rename it to the appropriate .password file in the relative directory, it'd dump flag. The big bit here is that's the <b>only</b> solve method as it uses the actual contents to XOR. Attached below is the source of the binary for further understanding.

<h3>Riscv Business</h3>
<p class="solution">
  <br/> <br />
    Riscv-Buissness performs rounded timing analysis against itself in RISC-V. This binary exploits the fact that QEMU does not apply correct priority to gettimeofday(). Using gettimeofday(), a benchmark is taken before and after a LOT of STDOUT writing. The program takes a benchmark of the first four correct characters, and shows the relative offsets from the "correct" int array. Without a reliable gettimeofday() this problem is a hard number theory problem requiring hundreds of runs and profiling.... However fixing QEMU's passed gettimeofday() with an LD_PRELOAD to pass to your system's gettimeofday will yield substantially more reliable results, making one run of the alphabet reveal every character's relative offset. Alternatively, using an updated version of SPIKE not from Ubuntu repos can do it too I think.

<h3>Quick Math</h3>

<p class="solution">
    quick_math uses your answers to calculate the address of a function to jump to. If you enter the right answers (8, 0, 151, 11) it will jump to a function that will congratulate you on being a math genius. By reversing the binary, you will find the string 'masoncc{XXXXXXXXXXXX}' in an unknown function. By analyzing the way the answers are processed you can craft a set of answers that will instead jump to the win function that prints the flag. the answers are decoded as follows:
    Each character of your input string is bitshifted right by one and then 29 is added to it. Because the least significant bit is lost, there are two possible characters for each value of the flag that the binary will think is correct. You have to look at the possibilities and figure out the english language flag <code>masoncc{sorry-im-a-bit-rusty}</code>
