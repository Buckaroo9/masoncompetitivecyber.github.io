<h3>Mason CC to host Crypsis March 28</h3>
<p>
Mason CC is proud to welcome Kirstie Failey, a Consultant from The Crypsis Group. Kirstie works with our President Michael Bailey and Co-President Paul Benoit at Crypsis. As a future sponsor of the club and a likely intern pipeline for this or next summer, Crypsis is an ideal company to better understand as a member of Mason CC. <b>For those less familiar with DFIR, while consultant may sound generic, consultants are the ones actually on the forensic cases.</b> She'll be coming to talk about the Incident Response process, something that likely ties into our previous Splunk and Host Based Forensics talks and, should you be hired as an intern at Crypsis, something you <i>would</i> either be directly involved with or support (even their development shop is largely used to support the case tasking).
<br/><br/>
In addition, the digital forensics and incident response work Crypsis (and specifically Kirstie) tends to do tends to remain technical and exciting, while not requiring some massive reverse engineering or cryptography experience unlike some of the other paths we've advertised in our organization.

<br/><br/>
All CC meetings are on Wednesday from 5-6pm.
