<h2>Mason Competitive Cyber and Patriot Hackers partnering to bring WarGames (1983) to campus</h2>


<p>When Mason CC talks about wargames, we're usually talking about competitions our club competes in.
But on this occasion, we're excited to present the movie WarGames, along with a PBS documentary called
"Cyber War!", <b><u><i>from noon to 4pm in the JC Cinema.</b></u></i></p>

<h3>Doors Open at Noon</h3>

<p>At noon, we're going to kick off "Cyber War!", a documentary based on events from primarily the early 2000s, talking about nation state hacking, using some relatively solid experts. We aren't expecting this to captivate massive audiences, and as such people are welcome to grab food, chat, and trickle in before 1pm.</p>

<p>At 1pm we will have a down period where we'll briefly discuss our two organizations, encourage discussion, and provide pretext  on the movie.</p>

<h3>Movie Starts at 1:30pm</h3>

<p>People should ideally be seated with whatever food and convo they want wrapped up, as we play WarGames. WarGames has an approximate runtime of a little under 2 hours. We aren't mean people so it's not like people have to stay in seats, but the movie will be starting at 1:30pm.</p>

<h3>Event Ends at 4:00pm</h3>

<p>The movie should end about 30 minutes before then assuming a perfectly run operation, and we may have  comments post-movie, but we will 100% be telling people to leave at 4pm as we lose the room.</p>
