<h3>Mason CC to host Robert Shein Again for PwC</h3>
<p>
Robert Shein of PwC will be covering power grid security at our February 7th meeting in JC Room <b>E</b>, from 5pm to 6pm. While we do not require speakers submit their talks (only topics), most experience levels will likely be comfortable with this talk based on past talks from this speaker. This topic will educate our organization on power grid security. Rob has been by before for an extremely popular car hacking talk. Per our policy, topics are technically tentative, so make sure to <a href="https://competitivecyber.club/meeting/">check our meetings page</a> in the unlikely event it will change.
