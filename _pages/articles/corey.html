<h3>Mason CC to host Corey Sheldon on System Hardening</h3>
<p>
Mason CC is proud to welcome Corey Sheldon. A former USMC Aviation Specialist, Corey now contributes to his own projects as well has Fedora, tutors students in IT and computer science concepts, and more. More details about his contributions to Fedora can be <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Linuxmodder">found here</a>. System hardening is essentially the practice of defending a system before it's attacked. This is especially important to our organization as <b>CC participates in both computer network defense and attack/defense competitions, both of which require you to secure your servers</b>. CC will pursue this even harder in 2018-2019, with initiatives targeting competitions like CCDC, a very popular CND event. Corey has demonstrated intimite knowledge in both the Linux and security spheres and we're looking forward to seeing what he has to say.
