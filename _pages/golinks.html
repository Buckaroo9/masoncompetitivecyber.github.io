Some were removed because they're entirely irrelevant at this point. This is a constant work in progress.

<ul>
<li><a href="https://go.gmu.edu/ccpowerpoints">Direct Link to Powerpoints Folder</a></li>
<li><a href="https://go.gmu.edu/ccbeginners">Beginners Link</a></li>
<li><a href="https://go.gmu.edu/cctraining">Full Drive Link</a></li>
<li><a href="https://go.gmu.edu/ccciphers">Ciphers Link (not really comprehensive)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://videos.competitivecyber.club">Club Talks</a></li>
</ul>
